****************************************************************************************************
React

  React is a javaScript library that is used to produce html that is shown to a user in the web browser
  componentes and views -> are snippets of javaScript code that produce html
    first we create the component
    then we insert it into the dom


  ************************************************** 
  React.DOM

    import React from 'react';           // used to create and manage components sometimes with non web dev apps (this is used to transpile JSX to HTML??)
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';    // this is used to manipulate the dom when working with browser web apps
                                         
    components need to be instanciated before they are rendered to the DOM
      -> when rendering to the dom you do not render the actual component (or stateless function) you render an instance of the function or class
         example : <App></App>
         example : <App />      // if the component text is empty is can be self closed

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector(".container"));    // renders the react component to the page
